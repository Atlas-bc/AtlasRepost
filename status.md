Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I've followed alongside a tutorial on how to remake the 2048 computer game. I've made the small change of using multiples of three in place of two. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to finish the tutorial, then I want to go back and find out how to add sfx and change the tile colors (change the theme). 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Still having problems on getting pygame to work (idle). Even though I went back and watched the recording for class.
